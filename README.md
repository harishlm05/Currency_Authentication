# currency Note Authentication

This project is a computer vision-based system designed to detect and verify the authenticity of  currency notes using ORB feature extraction and Brute-Force matching. The system compares input currency images against a database of genuine notes to determine their validity.

## Features

‚úî Feature Extraction ‚Äì Uses ORB to detect key security features on currency notes.

‚úî Brute-Force Matching ‚Äì Compares input notes with genuine references.

‚úî GUI Application ‚Äì User-friendly interface to upload and verify currency notes.

‚úî High Accuracy ‚Äì Achieves up to 95% accuracy in denomination detection.



## Installation

Prerequisites:

 1.Python 3.6+

 2.OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)

 3.NumPy (pip install numpy)

 4.Pillow (pip install pillow)

 5.Matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)




    
## Usage/Examples


1.Load a Currency Image

2.Click "Load Currency Image" to upload a note for verification.

3.Verify Authenticity

4.Click "Verify Currency" to check if the note is genuine or fake.

5.View Results

   The system displays:

   -Input image (left panel)
